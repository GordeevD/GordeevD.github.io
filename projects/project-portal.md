This project was part of a Software Engineering class at the University, spanning one month. It aimed to apply the knowledge we learned throughout the course. The professor formed groups of five students, and each group chose a project from a suggested list. Our group had three milestones, which we defined during our discussions.
The idea was to create a web application that would organize ongoing projects at the university, allow students to propose new projects, and showcase completed ones.
We based our web application on the Bowfolio template, which provided basic functionality for user profiles and a simple project list. We extended its capabilities by adding features such as a Showcase page for completed projects, a list of available projects, the ability to vote on projects, editing capabilities, additional fields, picture uploading functionality, and project status tracking.
