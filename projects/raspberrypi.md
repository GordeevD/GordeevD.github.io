The Raspberry Pi's compact size (about the size of a credit card) packs a powerful punch. 
This affordable, low-power single-board computer is a nearly ideal developer board, 
pairing well with a variety of sensors like temperature and pressure sensors, 
as well as wheels, actuators, and motors. I'm planning to experiment with building a stand-alone LLM system using Python libraries 
like TensorFlow and NumPy to interact with the hardware and create something truly unique, like a smart home device or a self-driving robot.
